## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Comprehensive testing infrastructure**: Added unit tests for configuration module with 100% coverage
- **Docker support**: Full Docker and Docker Compose setup with multi-service stack including monitoring
- **CLI management tool**: Feature-rich command-line interface for setup, monitoring, and maintenance
- **Health check server**: HTTP endpoints for health monitoring and statistics at `/health` and `/stats`
- **Memory management**: Automatic memory cleanup and garbage collection to prevent memory leaks
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better type safety and error handling throughout the codebase
- **Performance optimizations**: Database caching, connection pooling, and batch operation improvements
- **Additional Discord events**: Voice state updates, channel operations, member updates
- **Statistics collection**: Real-time bot performance metrics and database statistics
- **Production monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki integration for comprehensive observability

### Enhanced
- **Database module**: Added retry logic, connection management, health checks, and data cleanup utilities
- **Configuration validation**: Stricter validation with better error messages and type checking
- **Bot architecture**: Improved queue management, task coordination, and graceful shutdown handling
- Comprehensive pydantic field validators for configuration validation
- Tenacity-based retry logic with exponential backoff for database operations
- Proper async context management for database connections
- Memory-efficient deque-based message queues with size limits
- Garbage collection and memory cleanup tasks
- Enhanced error handling with retryable vs non-retryable error classification
- Additional Discord event handlers (voice state updates, bulk message deletes, channel operations)
- Database statistics collection and monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling with signal handlers
- Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
- Connection pooling and initialization state management
- Batch message processing with upsert operations to handle duplicates
- Enhanced checkpoint management system
- Configuration override support for testing
- Improved logging with both console and file output options

### Changed
- Upgraded configuration system to use pydantic-settings with proper BaseSettings
- Improved database operations to use upsert instead of insert for idempotency
- Enhanced message conversion with better error handling for individual message failures
- Refactored retry logic to use tenacity library for more robust error handling
- Improved queue processing with better batch handling and error recovery
- Enhanced checkpoint updates with proper timestamp handling
- Better memory management with tracked message limits to prevent memory leaks
- Improved guild and channel filtering logic with validation

### Fixed
- Configuration instantiation issues with BaseSettings
- Database connection state management and initialization
- Type annotation issues in database operations
- Memory leaks in processed message tracking
- Error handling in batch operations
- Checkpoint update data type issues
- Missing imports and dependency management
- Message content null handling
- Proper async context management

### Security
